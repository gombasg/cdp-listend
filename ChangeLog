        * Release: 1.0.17
        - Corrected a bug in the Solaris postinstall script

	I noticed that the Solaris sh generates an empty file if we
	do "sed command file > file" while it just appends a new copy
	if we do "sed command file >> file". To solve that, I put
	the contents into a temporal $variable and then I did an 
	"echo $variable > file". It works fine.

        * Release: 1.0.16
        - Solaris corrections related with the logging system.

	Changed in config.mk the Solaris Perl logging socket type from
	'stream' to 'inet'. There are five possible: 'stream', 'unix',
	'tcp', 'udp' or 'inet'. I checked that currently in Solaris only
	work properly 'udp' and 'inet'. The other ones give no errors
	but they didn't log the messages.

	Corrected in specfile.spec the postinstall script to add the
	daemon.info and daemon.debug entries to /etc/syslog.conf. I 
	noticed that the logger only works if we add the new entries
	following the existing ones, not at the beginning.

	Deleted the entry of the startup script rcinit-cdp-listend.cin
	related with the logging of the startup of the daemon. With
	the latest corrections, cdp-listend logs what it does properly
	but also logs when it is started.

        * Release: 1.0.15
        - Corrected the Solaris postinstall script.
	
	Now it will start the daemon after the installation of the package
	but only if the process wp4.install is not running. This process
	runs when a new machine is installed. If cdp-listend and cdispd 
	are running while installing a machine, they can call spma without
	any control at the same time we are installing the packages.

	I also changed the way to add to /etc/syslog.conf the daemon.info
	and daemon.debug entries. Now we add them to the first line which
	logs to /var/adm/messages. If we add them to a different newly
	created line, as before, the daemon.notice logs are logged twice
	to /var/adm/messages.

        * Release: 1.0.14

2005-07-06  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.0.12
        - General clean-up and update of the documentation. In particular,
	I removed the files MANIFEST, INSTALL and DEPENDENCIES because 
	they had very old and wrong information. I also completed and 
	corrected the README file, including the path of the documentation 
	directory which depends on the plataform. Then, I needed to change
	the name of the file from README to README.cin to substitute the
	@QTTR_DOC@ variable properly (and to reflect this change in the
	Makefile and the spec file).

2005-07-05  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.0.11
        - Corrected the Solaris postinstall script to restart the 
	syslog daemon if /etc/syslog.conf is modified

2005-05-10  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.0.7
        - Modifications to make the component Solaris-compatible.
	Added @QTTR_INITD@ to take into account the different startup scripts 
	directory for Linux and Solaris. Modified rcinit-cdp-listend.cin to 
	make the component compatible with the Solaris sh. Modified 
	specfile.spec to add and eliminate the needed links to /etc/rc*, 
	necessary to the startup and shutdown of the service on Solaris.

2004-06-23 German Cancio

        * Release: 0.9.7
        - added a initial poll for fetch and nch in case they're installed. This fixes Savannah #3178 and allows to have a consistent profile on startup time. On daemon startup, edg-cdp-listend will now invoke the client applications which are found to be installed locally (this can be either CCM fetch or NCH). In case of failure, a [WARN] message will be issued to syslog.

- The error message is now prefixed with [ERROR], and the invocation log 
  message is now issued *before* and not *after* execution. An error 
  message is generated in case fetch or nch fail.

0.9.6 (gcancio)
- added default config file

0.9.5 (gcancio)
- moved to LSB compliant paths

0.9.4
- added /usr/lib/perl to path

0.9.3
- logging messages fixed

0.9.2
- smearing added

0.9.0
- started
(bases on the code of ccm-edg-listend written by Michael George)
